<h1>About this site</h1>
<p>This is a client that I made for the current API, I hope you enjoyed</p>
<p>And yes, I know that the best solution would be to add a ElasticSearch, but this week I was short in time</p>

<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I'm just a curious person</p>
<p>You can find my projects on my <a href="https://github.com/shiryel">Github</a></p>
<p>I have a blog too, here is the <a href="https://blog.shiryel.com/">link</a></p>

<h2>Why the name Shiryel?</h2>
<p>Its just an public alias, I dont like to have much attention but nowadays is necessary :P</p>
<p>And yes, I created and drawed him</p>
